# Cookie-Recipe-Webscraper

## Description

The ultimate purpose of this project is to go obtain the highest rating cookie recipes from allrecipes.com .
It consists of a Python script that uses Selenium to scrape the data from the website by first filtering through the highest rated recipes
followed by clicking on each of those recipes. For each of those recipes, data about the ingredients and instructions
are collected.

This is still a work in progress.
